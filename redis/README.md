This is minimal Redis in C (and some minimal C++). It is done using

# Makefile
I was a bit rusty on Makefile and thus needed some refresher to get going. These
were the links that were handy:
1. https://makefiletutorial.com/
2. [Stackoverflow Q&A](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/255664/makefile-for-multiple-executables)

Link 2 was particularly helpful as it was about compiling multiple executables
in a single Makefile.
