# build-my-own-x
This repository is inspired from the following wonderful collections:
* https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning
* https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x
* https://build-your-own.org/
* https://codecrafters.io/

I am hoping to attempt some of them here. Each project goes in a separate
folder. If re-attempted in a different language it might be pushed in a further
sub-folder. Let me see how things progress.
